# acrylic.vim

A little notetaking/task format I made for myself, modeled mostly after
Markdown, Org-mode, and LaTeX. Its main difference is the focus on
indentation and line spacing to separate items.

At the moment it is compatible with Vim, I believe. But that might
change in the future.

## Example

See [doc/acrylic-example.acr](doc/acrylic-example.acr)

## Why "acrylic"?

I was thinking of a name and the word came to mind. It works as an
analogy where this format is acrylic and others - such as Markdown, Org
and LaTeX - are glass.

Glass is usually more robust, but it can also be heavier and more
expensive. In contrast, Acrylic is less resistant to scratches, UV rays
and germs, but it's light and cheap.

It's a really bad analogy. But the name's nice. Sorry.
